In migrating NorhtwindIB.mdf to SQL Compact, we found the following issues:

1) SDF unsupported types:
   - Geometry
   - Geography
   - DateTimeOffset
   - Time

2) SQL Compact only accepts Integers as Identity fields.

3) SQL Compact provider does not support isnull. (To be fixed in EF6 - see http://entityframework.codeplex.com/workitem/287)
