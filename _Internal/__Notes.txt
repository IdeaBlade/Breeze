    Open Command Prompt from Breeze.Client\Scripts\IBlade 
    Run
        yuidoc -t "C:\GitLocal\Breeze\apidoc-theme\breeze" .

Powershell
    Start with an 'admin' security command prompt

    then for each of these powershell executables - they look reversed but they are correct.
        32-bit PowerShell 	C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
        64-bit PowerShell 	C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

    run
        set-executionpolicy remotesigned

Misc Notes:
  1) entityType is on the entity instead of the entityAspect because it is actually on the prototype and is shared by all instances of the type.
  2) Look at knockout js - valueHasMutated for perf.
  4) odata skip will fail against a EF source without an orderBy
  5) id fixup cannot occur with unidirectional navigation
  6) Decided to omit having a 'SetAdded' method. Calling SetAdded on entity with 'identity' key and then saving will 
     create a new entity and will return it in 'unchanged' state and leave original in its 'added' state. 

Todo:
  1) Make all fromJSON methods - internal
  2) Make all EntityGroup refs internal
  4) Insure that a server query for a resourceName that is not in metadata i.e. "CustomerAndOrders", adds to the client side resourceName map when it returns.
  13) Add tests for fixup cleanup after a RejectChanges call.
    
Think about:
  1) Adding AndWhere and OrWhere methods to EntityQuery
  2) Standard method for documenting an 'interface' i.e. entityTracking or remoteAccess
  4) Think about IsNull query operator - not sure how to express in Odata.
  6) Think about subclassing and extending simple datatypes.
  7) allowing case insensitive prop names anywhere you would otherwise HAVE to throw an exception
  8) orig value check on set to revert isModified if changing a value back to its original value
