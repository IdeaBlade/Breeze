Notes: 
  Linq to OData - projection (select restrictions)
    - project into anon types only
	- no aliasing
	- can only project properties 

	- EntityAspect EntityManager & EntityGroup properties are set if an entity was ever attached. 
	This is not cleared when an entity is detached.  This assumption removes a lot of special purpose logic
	- Only the MetadataStore and immutable types are ThreadSafe.  Any property returned by the MetadataStore 
	must therefore also be either immutable or thread safe itself. (all StructuralTypes are effectively immutable)

Think about
-------------
Abiltity to configure clr namespace mapping - server name: Foo.Customer - client name: Bar.Cust
A Breeze specific Http exception that include both a status code and a message.
Enum for flags like InProcess, IsLoading etc ( probably not a good idea for booleans that have a concept of inheritance)
Test the incoming Metadata to insure that it matches the Clr descriptions.
If moving MetadataInfo from .NET to JS and back NamingConventions are likely not compatible - so what do we do ???
ShortName map
NullEntity
