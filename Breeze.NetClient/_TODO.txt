ToDo
---------------------------
LocalQuery
Validation and INotifyDataErrorInfo
Inheritance
Saves
NamedQueries
NoTracking queries
ShortName map
IEditableObject
UntrackedProperties added directly to Clr type defs.
CodeGeneration - 
Metadata by hand 
Export/Import



Notes: 
	- EntityAspect EntityManager & EntityGroup properties are set if an entity was ever attached. 
	This is not cleared when an entity is detached.  This assumption removes a lot of special purpose logic
	- Only the MetadataStore and immutable types are ThreadSafe.  Any property returned by the MetadataStore 
	must therefore also be either immutable or thread safe itself. (all StructuralTypes are effectively immutable)

Think about
-------------
Enum for flags like InProcess, IsLoading etc ( probably not a good idea for booleans that have a concept of inheritance)
Test the incoming Metadata to insure that it matches the Clr descriptions.



Extensions for later ( that we can charge for)
--------------------------------------------
Property interception
PostSharp (or other static IL weaver support)
Query filters (like devforce - registered on the EntityManager and applied to queries before execution)
GetEntityGraph
EntityQueryPager
Logging/Tracing
Dynamic linq
DesignTime functionality ???
Silverlight 5 ( ??? )
Enhanced validation
Enhanced offline
Linq verbs not natively supported by OData (hard)
MEF???
