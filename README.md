# Breeze.js

Breeze is a data management library for JavaScript that makes it easy to query data from the server. Breeze’s simple, yet powerful API allows you to make complex queries against the server, cache the data on the client for performance, and supports offline scenarios.

When used with a databinding framework like Knockout, Breeze enables you to code in a familiar architectural pattern like MVC or MVVM and keep your view separate from your business logic.

## Prerequisites
To build the Todo sample the following must first be installed on your system:

If you're using Visual Studio 2010:
- ASP.NET MVC 4 
- Web Platform Installer
- IIS Express
- You must allow NuGet to download packages during builds. (Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Settings)

If you're using Visual Studio 2012:
- None. VS 2012 takes care of it all as long as you allow NuGet to download packages during builds.
