##The local cache

Prior examples have shown breeze querying a remote service for data.  This tutorial is focused
on showing how the same query or any other query can be executed against the local Javascript client. 

The reason we are able to do this is that the "Breeze* "EntityManager" class that we have been using in 
all of our examples to perform queries also provides "entity caching" services.  Basically every *Breeze*
query that returns a collection of entities, also caches these entities so that they can be looked up later
without having to go back to the server.

To demonstrate this, let's start by **running** the simple "Customers" query on the right.

This query should have returned a fairly long list of "Customers".

Now let's try executing this same query again a second time, only this time without going to the server, immediately after the first query completes. 

>  *This is obviously not a normal use case.  Normally, we would use this facility to perform a query that returned a subset of what the original query did
>  and we would perform this "subset" query at some later point within an application session.*

In this case we do not want to render our output until after the 2nd query completes. 

The easist way to accomplish this is replace the "executeQuery" call in the "JavaScript" pane with the following

>     manager.executeQuery(query).then(function(data) {
>         // we are going to ignore the results of the query - the "data" parameter above
>         var customers = manager.executeQueryLocally(query);
>         // put the results in a structure that Knockout recognizes
>         var localQueryData = { results: customers };
>         ko.applyBindings(localQueryData);
>     }).fail(function(e) {
>        alert(e);  
>     });

Go ahead and **Run** this.

A couple of things to notice.  

- the results should not have changed.
- we didn't need to use a "Promise" for the executeQueryLocally call. This method is synchronous.
- we didn't change the query in any way.

Ok, now let's make this a bit more realistic by changing the local query that we execute.

This time replace the "executeQuery" call in the "JavaScript" pane with the following "subset query";

>     manager.executeQuery(query).then(function(data) {
>         // we are going to ignore the results of the query - the "data" parameter above
>         var query2 = query.where("CompanyName", "startsWith", "C");
>         var customers = manager.executeQueryLocally(query2);
>         // put the results in a structure that Knockout recognizes
>         var localQueryData = { results: customers };
>         ko.applyBindings(localQueryData);
>     }).fail(function(e) {
>        alert(e);  
>     });

and press **Run**.

Only customers with company names beginning with "C" should have been shown this time.

### The FetchStrategy        
There are a couple of other ways to execute a query locally in "Breeze".  They both involve making use of a "FetchStrategy".  The two approaches are:

- change the "FetchStrategy" of an individual query.
- change the "FetchStrategy" of an entire EntityManager.

A "FetchStrategy" is a *Breeze* enumeration that has two possible values:

- FetchStrategy.FromServer
- FetchStrategy.FromLocalCache

Up until now we have been using the default; FetchStrategy.FromServer. 

To set the FetchStrategy on a single query, let's change the "executeQuery" method in the "Javascript" pane to this:

>     manager.executeQuery(query).then(function(data) {
>         // we are going to ignore the results of the query - the "data" parameter above
>         var query2 = query.where("CompanyName", "startsWith", "C")
>                     .using(breeze.FetchStrategy.FromLocalCache);
>         manager.executeQuery(query2).then(function(dataSubset) {
>            ko.applyBindings(dataSubset);
>         });
>     }).fail(function(e) {
>         alert(e);  
>     });

Now press **Run**.

Hopefully, the results haven't changed, only customers with company names beginning with "C" should be shown. 

Note that we are using the "using" method to modify *query2*, so that it will only execute against the local EntityManager cache. Also note that
we are back to using "Promises".  

This points to one of the basic differences between using the "executeQueryLocally" method vs. changing the "FetchStrategy" of a query.  The "executeQueryLocally" method
returns its results directly but has a different syntax for executing the query, whereas when changing the "FetchStrategy", the query is executed in the same fashion as a 
"FromServer" query, but under the covers its behavior changes.  

>  * Queries with FetchStrategy.FromLocalCache are still performed synchronously, but they simulate an "asynchronous" callback in order to keep the api consistent.
